**Frozen Lands** is a Take Some() Java / jMonkeyEngine game-runtime prototype: a cold open-world foundation with terrain, player control, physics, particles, save/runtime modules, provider systems, and a Java-backed Lua scripting bridge.

This repository is an **alpha development workspace**, not a finished game release. It is intended for engine/runtime development, gameplay-system prototyping, and modular game architecture work.

## Project status

Frozen Lands is currently focused on building the runtime base:

- 3D application bootstrap on top of jMonkeyEngine.
- Modular engine architecture through `modulesSrc`.
- Runtime command/event ABI for systems and providers.
- Player, terrain, particle, shader, world, and save modules.
- Lua scripts executed through a single Java core bridge.
- Manifest diagnostics for validating registered modules and commands.

The codebase changes quickly. Public releases, packaging, and stable modding contracts are not finalized yet.

`modulesSrc` is part of the production source graph. Each module can contain Java sources, Lua API files, runtime config, and assets. Gradle discovers module Java source directories from `module.index.json` files.

---

## Runtime modules

Frozen Lands uses a command/event ABI around `ModuleRegistry` and `ProviderRegistry`.

| Module ID | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `engine.bootstrap` | Bootstrap configuration. |
| `engine.core` | Core runtime bridge, console routing, Lua script execution. |
| `engine.providers` | Provider registry descriptor exposed to Lua. |
| `engine.material` | Material loading and lookup. |
| `engine.model` | Model loading, attach/detach, and lookup. |
| `engine.sound` | Sound loading and playback. |
| `engine.world` | World runtime commands and spawn facade. |
| `engine.terrain` | Terrain chunks, height queries, spawn location. |
| `engine.shaders` | Post-processing and shadow settings. |
| `engine.particles` | Snow, transient particle effects, impacts. |
| `engine.player` | Player status, position, and warp commands. |
| `engine.save` | Snapshot, save, load, and save listing. |

---

## Lua scripting

Lua is embedded as an engine scripting layer. Scripts run through `engine.core` and call Java systems through one bridge.

Core script commands:

```text
engine.core script.manifest
engine.core script.list
engine.core script.read
engine.core script.run
engine.core script.autorun
```

Default script config:

```text
modulesSrc/engine/modules/core/assets/config/runtime.json
```

Default startup script:

```text
modulesSrc/engine/modules/core/assets/scripts/startup.lua
```

Example:

```lua
local core = require("engine.core")

core.emit("core.script.loaded", {
  script = script.name,
  path = script.path,
  autorun = args.autoRun == true
})

return true
```

Module facade example:

```lua
local particles = require("engine.particles")

particles.call("snow.enable", { enabled = true })
particles.call("snow.rate", { rate = 450 })
```

The embedded Lua runtime is intentionally sandboxed. Direct `io`, `os`, `debug`, `luajava`, `dofile`, and `loadfile` access is disabled.

---

## Requirements

- JDK 17 or newer.
- The Gradle wrapper included in this repository.
- Required Take Some() local Maven artifacts installed in Maven Local until all internal runtime packages are published publicly.
- Windows is the currently validated desktop development target for this workspace.

---

## Build and run

Build the project:

```bat
gradlew.bat clean build
```

Run the desktop application:

```bat
gradlew.bat run
```

On Unix-like systems, use `./gradlew` instead of `gradlew.bat` if all required runtime dependencies and native libraries are available for the platform.

---

## Runtime diagnostics

Frozen Lands includes a manifest reporter for checking registered providers, modules, and required commands.

Use these VM options for a manifest diagnostic run:

```text
-Dfrozenlands.runtimeManifest=true
-Dfrozenlands.runtimeManifestExit=true
```

The diagnostic output is useful after changing modules, providers, Lua API files, or the runtime command ABI.

---

## Development notes

- Keep `module.index.json` in sync with module assets, configs, and Lua API files.
- Keep Java package names under `org.takesome.frozenlands`.
- Treat `modulesSrc` as runtime source, not as a scratch directory.
- Keep module commands stable once Lua scripts or tools depend on them.
- Use `engine.core.script.run` for executing indexed Lua scripts instead of bypassing the bridge.
